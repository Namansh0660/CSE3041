# CSE3041 â€“Programming for Data Science 

# PART - A
#1. Create vector 'student' to store the names of 5 students 
#2. Use assign() function to create a vector 'Marks' to store the marks scored by these students. 
#3. Display the mark of student3. 
#4. Combine the vectors 'student' and 'Marks' as details. 
#5. Find the length of combined vector 'details'. 
#6. Find the minimum mark and print the student who scored it. 
#7. Find the maximum average mark and print the student who scored it. 
#8. Find the total marks scored by all the students. 
#9. Find the mean of the marks scored by all students 
#10. Find the standard deviation of the marks scored by all students 
#11. Arrange the marks in ascending order. 

# PART-B
#12. Create a list to maintain the details of a student such as registration number, name, no. of courses registered and marks in each subject. 
#13. Retrieve the name of the student. 
#14. Extract only the registration number and the marks of the student. 
#15. Access the mark in the first course registered. 
#16. Modify the mark entry in the last course as 5 more than the existing mark
